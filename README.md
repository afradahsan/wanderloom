# Wanderloom
✨Wanderloom is a project that I've built completely using Flutter and Firebase.

## Getting Started!!
Wanderloom goes beyond being just a travel app; its your gateway to
seamless, stress-free adventures. With an intuitive Itinerary Planner,
Budget Tracker, and Backpack Essentials, Wanderloom ensures you're
always prepared for your journey. The upcoming Budget Management
feature, inspired by the efficiency of Splitwise, will redefine how you
manage expenses during group travel.🌎

Our app is more than just functionalities; it's a commitment to
empowering every traveler to explore like never before. Wanderloom is
proudly crafted using Flutter, ensuring a delightful user experience.
Elevate your travel experience by choosing Wanderloom for journeys that
turn into unforgettable memories.✈
